# Peak Seats Sports Website

## Introduction

Peak Seats is a sports website developed to demonstrate how a functional
web system can be built without using a traditional database. Instead,
it uses an API to handle user registration and login. The project
focuses on simplicity, organization, and ease of use, making it suitable
for beginners in web development.

## Project Description

Peak Seats is a front-end sports information website that displays
multiple sports categories and allows users to register, log in, and
view their profile information. User authentication is managed using an
API rather than a database system.

design and structured navigation.
